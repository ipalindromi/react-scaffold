# Purpose

This is a simple scaffolding project with a React frontend set up the way I use it 99% of the time. If you want to use it, or fork it, or whatever, great!

I find myself wanting to through together React apps to test ideas all the time. It can be a pain to set everything up, even with a lot of practice, so I decided to just put everything here.

The point is to get up and prototyping **fast**.

## Usage

Just run `yarn install` after cloning.

`yarn start` will start the application.

# Features

-   Renders a simple page out of the box
-   No configuration. Just start building your app.
-   Pre-structured
-   Different branches for different setups

## Branches

Because I don't always need all features, there are a few branches that have different base setups:

-   master
-   redux

Use as in `git checkout redux`

### Master

A basic setup with no redux.

### Redux

A basic stup with redux pre-wired.
